# Automatic Video Thumbnail Generation

## Overview

This feature automatically generates thumbnails from uploaded videos using Cloudinary's eager transformations. When a user uploads a video, the system now creates a 400x300 pixel thumbnail image alongside the video.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Changes

- Added `videoThumbnail` field to the `NewProductSchema` in `model/newproductdata.js`
- This field stores the URL of the automatically generated thumbnail

### 2. Cloudinary Service Updates

- Modified `services/cloudinary.service.js` to include thumbnail generation in video uploads
- Added eager transformation for thumbnail generation:
  ```javascript
  {
    format: 'jpg',
    width: 400,
    height: 300,
    crop: 'thumb',
    gravity: 'auto',
    quality: 'auto',
  }
  ```

### 3. Controller Updates

- Updated `controller/newproduct.controller.js` to handle thumbnail URLs
- Added `extractVideoUrls()` helper function to extract both video and thumbnail URLs from Cloudinary response
- Modified both `addProduct` and `updateProduct` functions to save thumbnail URLs

## How It Works

1. **Video Upload**: When a video is uploaded, Cloudinary processes it with two eager transformations:
   - AV1 video format for optimal playback
   - JPG thumbnail (400x300px) for preview

2. **URL Extraction**: The system extracts both URLs from the Cloudinary response:
   - `videoUrl`: The optimized video URL
   - `videoThumbnailUrl`: The generated thumbnail URL

3. **Database Storage**: Both URLs are stored in the database:
   - `video`: The video URL
   - `videoThumbnail`: The thumbnail URL

## API Response

When creating or updating a product with a video, the response will include:

```json
{
  "video": "https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/video/upload/v1234567890/your-video.mp4",
  "videoThumbnail": "https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/video/upload/v1234567890/your-video.jpg"
}
```

## Usage

### Creating a Product with Video

```javascript
// The video upload will automatically generate a thumbnail
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('video', videoFile);
formData.append('name', 'Product Name');
// ... other product fields

const response = await fetch('/api/products', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData,
});
```

### Updating a Product with Video

```javascript
// When updating with a new video, both video and thumbnail will be updated
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('video', newVideoFile);
// ... other updated fields

const response = await fetch('/api/products/:id', {
  method: 'PUT',
  body: formData,
});
```

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Generation**: No manual thumbnail creation required
2. **Consistent Size**: All thumbnails are 400x300 pixels
3. **Optimized Quality**: Uses Cloudinary's auto quality optimization
4. **Smart Cropping**: Uses `gravity: 'auto'` for intelligent thumbnail positioning
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing products without thumbnails continue to work

## Testing

You can test the feature using the provided test script:

```bash
node test-video-thumbnail.js
```

Make sure to:

1. Place a test video file named `test-video.mp4` in the project root
2. Set your Cloudinary upload preset in environment variables

## Notes

- Thumbnails are generated synchronously (`eager_async: false`) to ensure they're available immediately
- The thumbnail format is JPG for optimal web display
- Thumbnail dimensions are 400x300 pixels, which is suitable for most UI layouts
- When updating a product with a new video, the old thumbnail is also deleted from Cloudinary
